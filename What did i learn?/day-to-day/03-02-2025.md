# **DAY 1**

## **Core Concepts**

### **Cluster Architecture**

#### **What is a Cluster?**
- **Kubernetes Architecture**

#### **What is a Node?**
A node is a physical or virtual machine that runs containerized applications.

- **VM and Physical Hosts**
- **Types of Nodes:**
  - **Master Node (Control Plane):**
    - **API Server (`kube-apiserver`)**: The front-end for Kubernetes, handling requests (kubectl API calls).
    - **Scheduler (`kube-scheduler`)**: Assigns workloads (Pods) to worker nodes based on resource availability.
    - **Controller Manager (`kube-controller-manager`)**: Runs background processes to maintain the desired state (e.g., ReplicaSets, Node health checks).
    - **ETCD**: A distributed key-value store that holds cluster data (configuration, state).
  
  - **Worker Nodes (Compute Nodes):**
    - **Kubelet**: Ensures containers in a Pod are running correctly and communicates with the master node.
    - **Container Runtime**: Runs containers (Docker, containerd, CRI-O).
    - **Kube Proxy**: Manages networking and load balancing for Pods.

#### **What is a Pod?**
- The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes.
- A Pod can contain **one or more containers** that share **storage and networking**.

### **Basic `kubectl` Commands**
Use the following commands to interact with Kubernetes:

- `kubectl run` – Run a new Pod.
- `kubectl create` – Create a resource.
- `kubectl get` – Retrieve information about resources.
- `kubectl describe` – Get detailed information about a resource.
- `kubectl delete` – Remove a resource.
- `kubectl apply` – Apply configurations from a file.
- `kubectl logs` – Fetch logs from a Pod.
