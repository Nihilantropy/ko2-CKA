# **DAY 2**

## **Core Concepts**

---

### **Replication Controller / Replica Sets**
- **Replication Controller** and **Replica Sets** ensure that a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time.  
- They monitor the state of the pods and automatically replace any that fail or are terminated, maintaining the desired state.  
- **Replica Sets** are the next-generation replication controller and support set-based label selectors, offering more flexibility in managing groups of pods.

---

### **Deployments**
- **Deployments** manage the rollout and update of Replica Sets, providing declarative updates to pods and Replica Sets.  
- They enable features such as rolling updates, rollbacks, and version control, which allow you to easily transition between different versions of an application.  
- Using deployments, you can ensure that your application is updated smoothly with minimal downtime.

### **Service**
- A **Service** in Kubernetes provides a stable network endpoint for accessing a set of pods, abstracting the dynamic nature of pod IP addresses.  
- It enables load balancing, service discovery, and decouples the service consumers from the pod lifecycle.  
- Various service types (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer) cater to different use cases, ranging from internal communication to exposing applications externally.
