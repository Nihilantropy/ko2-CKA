## 3. Queueing Phase Plugins

The Queueing Phase is the entry point for pods that are pending scheduling. At this stage, pods are organized into a scheduling queue where they await further processing. Custom plugins can be integrated into this phase to pre-process, validate, and modify pods before they proceed to the subsequent scheduling phases.

### 3.1 Purpose of the Queueing Phase

**Overview:**  
The primary goal of the Queueing Phase is to manage the flow of incoming pods by placing them into a well-ordered queue. This ensures that the scheduler handles pods systematically and efficiently.

**Key Functions:**

- **Initial Pod Processing:**  
  Pods are admitted into the scheduling system and undergo preliminary checks before any complex scheduling decisions are made.
  
- **Prioritization and Ordering:**  
  By organizing pods in a queue, the scheduler can apply prioritization strategies, ensuring that higher-priority or time-sensitive pods are processed earlier.
  
- **Early Rejections:**  
  The Queueing Phase can be used to filter out pods that are not yet ready for scheduling or that violate certain preliminary criteria. This helps avoid unnecessary computation in later stages.

- **Preparation for Further Phases:**  
  Enhancements or modifications made during this phase, such as adding metadata or annotations, set the stage for more sophisticated decision-making during filtering and scoring.

### 3.2 Pre-Queue and Post-Queue Plugins

To maximize the effectiveness of the Queueing Phase, Kubernetes allows for the integration of both pre-queue and post-queue plugins. These plugins provide hooks to insert custom logic at different points in the queuing process.

#### Pre-Queue Plugins

- **Functionality:**  
  Pre-queue plugins run **before** a pod is placed in the scheduling queue. They can perform initial validation, enforce admission policies, or modify pod specifications as needed.
  
- **Use Cases:**  
  - **Validation:** Ensure that pods meet certain criteria (e.g., resource requests, labels, or annotations) before they are considered for scheduling.
  - **Annotation or Enrichment:** Automatically add or adjust metadata to pods to assist in later scheduling phases.
  - **Early Rejection:** Reject pods that do not adhere to cluster policies, thereby reducing the load on subsequent phases.

#### Post-Queue Plugins

- **Functionality:**  
  Post-queue plugins are executed **after** a pod has been added to the queue. They provide an opportunity to further refine the pod’s information or adjust its scheduling priority based on additional context.
  
- **Use Cases:**  
  - **Priority Adjustment:** Dynamically alter the pod’s priority in the queue based on real-time metrics or external factors.
  - **Metadata Augmentation:** Enrich the pod’s scheduling context with additional data required for filtering or scoring.
  - **Queue Reordering:** Influence the order in which pods are dequeued, ensuring that more critical pods are addressed sooner.

### 3.3 Example Queueing Plugins

To illustrate how queueing phase plugins can be implemented, consider the following examples:

#### 1. **Pod Validation Plugin**

- **Purpose:**  
  A pre-queue plugin that checks whether a pod meets basic resource request guidelines before it enters the scheduling queue.
  
- **Behavior:**  
  - Inspects the pod’s resource requests.
  - Rejects pods that request more resources than available in the cluster.
  - Optionally adds annotations to mark the pod for special handling in later phases.

#### 2. **Priority Adjustment Plugin**

- **Purpose:**  
  A post-queue plugin designed to adjust the ordering of pods in the queue based on custom priority criteria.
  
- **Behavior:**  
  - Evaluates metrics such as pod age, business-critical labels, or even external system health indicators.
  - Updates the pod’s priority score, ensuring that high-priority pods are scheduled first.
  - Can reorder the queue dynamically as new information becomes available.

#### 3. **Queue Sorting Plugin**

- **Purpose:**  
  A plugin that focuses on the overall ordering of pods within the scheduling queue.
  
- **Behavior:**  
  - Implements a custom sorting algorithm that takes multiple factors into account (e.g., fairness, resource requirements, and affinity rules).
  - Reorders the queue periodically or in response to certain triggers.
  - Helps balance the load across the cluster by ensuring that pods with conflicting requirements do not cluster at the front of the queue.

---

**Summary:**  
The Queueing Phase is crucial for establishing an orderly and efficient flow of pods into the scheduling pipeline. By implementing custom pre-queue and post-queue plugins, administrators can enforce early validation, prioritize critical workloads, and enrich pod data. These customizations not only enhance the scheduling process but also ensure that the cluster handles workloads in an optimized, policy-compliant manner.
