## 7. Developing a Custom Scheduling Plugin

Custom scheduling plugins allow you to extend and tailor the Kubernetes scheduling process to meet specific operational or business requirements. This section guides you through the steps of developing, registering, and deploying a custom scheduling plugin using Go.

### 7.1 Writing a Custom Scheduling Plugin in Go

**Overview:**  
Developing a custom scheduling plugin in Go involves writing code that implements the plugin interface defined by the Kubernetes scheduler framework. Your plugin will integrate with one of the scheduling phases (queueing, filtering, scoring, or binding) to inject custom logic into the scheduling pipeline.

**Steps:**

1. **Set Up Your Development Environment:**  
   - Install Go (version 1.18 or later is recommended).
   - Set up your workspace and import necessary Kubernetes scheduler framework packages.

2. **Implement the Plugin Interface:**  
   Each scheduling phase has its own interface. For example, if you are developing a scoring plugin, you might implement the `ScorePlugin` interface. Below is an example snippet for a simple scoring plugin:

   ```go
   package myscoringplugin

   import (
       "context"
       "k8s.io/kubernetes/pkg/scheduler/framework"
       "k8s.io/kubernetes/pkg/scheduler/framework/runtime"
   )

   // Name is the name of the plugin used in the plugin registry and configurations.
   const Name = "MyScoringPlugin"

   // MyScoringPlugin is a scoring plugin that implements the ScorePlugin interface.
   type MyScoringPlugin struct {
       handle framework.Handle
   }

   // New initializes a new instance of MyScoringPlugin.
   func New(configuration runtime.Object, handle framework.Handle) (framework.Plugin, error) {
       return &MyScoringPlugin{
           handle: handle,
       }, nil
   }

   // Name returns name of the plugin. It is used in logs, etc.
   func (pl *MyScoringPlugin) Name() string {
       return Name
   }

   // Score invoked at the scoring phase to assign a score to a node.
   func (pl *MyScoringPlugin) Score(ctx context.Context, state *framework.CycleState, pod *v1.Pod, nodeName string) (int64, *framework.Status) {
       // Implement custom logic here. For example, a simple static score.
       return 10, framework.NewStatus(framework.Success)
   }

   // ScoreExtensions of the Score plugin.
   func (pl *MyScoringPlugin) ScoreExtensions() framework.ScoreExtensions {
       return pl
   }

   // NormalizeScore invoked after scoring to normalize the scores across all nodes.
   func (pl *MyScoringPlugin) NormalizeScore(ctx context.Context, state *framework.CycleState, pod *v1.Pod, scores framework.NodeScoreList) *framework.Status {
       // Optionally adjust scores, e.g., scale them between 0 and 100.
       return framework.NewStatus(framework.Success)
   }
   ```

   **Key Considerations:**
   - **Error Handling:** Ensure proper error checking and logging throughout your plugin.
   - **Performance:** Keep your logic efficient to avoid slowing down the scheduling process.
   - **Extensibility:** Design your plugin so that it can be easily extended or modified as requirements evolve.

3. **Unit Testing Your Plugin:**  
   - Write tests for your plugin’s logic using Go’s testing framework.
   - Mock the scheduler framework’s dependencies to simulate different scheduling scenarios.

### 7.2 Registering the Plugin with the Scheduler

**Overview:**  
Once your plugin is developed and tested, you need to register it with the Kubernetes scheduler. This typically involves modifying the scheduler’s configuration file to include your custom plugin.

**Steps:**

1. **Update Scheduler Configuration:**  
   - Edit the scheduler configuration YAML file to reference your custom plugin by its registered name. For example:

     ```yaml
     apiVersion: kubescheduler.config.k8s.io/v1beta2
     kind: KubeSchedulerConfiguration
     profiles:
     - schedulerName: default-scheduler
       plugins:
         score:
           enabled:
           - name: MyScoringPlugin
       pluginConfig:
       - name: MyScoringPlugin
         args:
           # Pass any required plugin arguments here
     ```

2. **Rebuild and Restart the Scheduler:**  
   - If you are running a custom scheduler, rebuild it with your plugin included.
   - Restart the scheduler to apply the new configuration. Verify that the logs indicate your plugin has been successfully loaded.

### 7.3 Deploying and Testing the Plugin in a Kubernetes Cluster

**Overview:**  
After registering your custom scheduling plugin, the next step is to deploy the updated scheduler configuration and test the plugin’s functionality in a live Kubernetes cluster.

**Steps:**

1. **Deploy the Updated Scheduler:**
   - If using a custom scheduler, update your deployment manifest to use the new scheduler image or configuration.
   - Apply the updated manifests to your cluster:

     ```bash
     kubectl apply -f path/to/your/scheduler-deployment.yaml
     ```

2. **Deploy Test Pods:**  
   - Create test pods that trigger the scheduling process.
   - Monitor the scheduler logs to ensure that your plugin’s logic is being invoked and that it is influencing scheduling decisions as expected.

3. **Validation and Monitoring:**
   - **Logs:** Check the scheduler logs for messages related to your plugin. Confirm that your custom logic is applied and that there are no unexpected errors.
   - **Metrics:** If your plugin emits custom metrics or events, integrate these with your monitoring systems for real-time feedback.
   - **Test Scenarios:** Run a series of test scenarios to validate that your plugin behaves as expected under various conditions. Adjust the plugin code based on the observed outcomes.

4. **Iterate and Refine:**  
   - Based on the test results, iterate on your plugin’s code. Continue refining your implementation, enhancing error handling, and optimizing performance as needed.

---

**Summary:**  
Developing a custom scheduling plugin in Go involves writing code that implements the Kubernetes scheduler framework interface, registering the plugin with the scheduler, and then deploying and testing it in your Kubernetes cluster. By following these steps, you can tailor the scheduling behavior to fit your specific workload requirements and operational constraints, thereby enhancing your cluster’s overall efficiency and responsiveness.
