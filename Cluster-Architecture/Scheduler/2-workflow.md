# **2. Scheduler Workflow**

The Scheduler Workflow outlines the steps that the Kubernetes Scheduler follows to assign unscheduled Pods to appropriate Nodes. This process ensures that Pods are placed on Nodes that best meet their resource requirements, constraints, and policies.

---

## **2.1 Monitoring and Queueing**

- **Pod Watch**:  
  The scheduler continuously monitors the Kubernetes API for Pods that are in a pending state and have not yet been assigned to any Node.

- **Queueing**:  
  Unscheduled Pods are placed in a scheduling queue. The scheduler processes these Pods one by one, determining the best Node for each based on current cluster conditions.

---

## **2.2 Filtering Candidate Nodes**

- **Feasibility Check**:  
  For each unscheduled Pod, the scheduler evaluates all available Nodes to determine which ones meet the Pod’s basic resource requirements (CPU, memory, etc.) and satisfy any node selectors or other constraints.

- **Constraints Enforcement**:  
  The scheduler checks constraints such as taints and tolerations, ensuring that only Nodes that can accept the Pod (or that the Pod tolerates) are considered.

---

## **2.3 Ranking and Scoring**

- **Prioritization**:  
  The scheduler assigns scores to the filtered candidate Nodes based on various criteria. These may include available resources, Node affinity/anti-affinity rules, balanced resource distribution, and custom policies.

- **Scoring Algorithms**:  
  Kubernetes uses a combination of built-in scoring functions and custom extensions (if configured) to rank Nodes. The highest-scoring Node is selected as the best candidate for the Pod.

---

## **2.4 Binding the Pod**

- **Binding Operation**:  
  Once a Node is chosen, the scheduler creates a binding object that associates the Pod with the selected Node. This binding is then sent to the Kubernetes API Server.

- **State Update**:  
  The Pod’s status is updated to reflect its new assignment, and the Node begins running the Pod’s containers according to its specification.

---

## **2.5 Continuous Reconciliation**

- **Reevaluation**:  
  The scheduler continuously monitors the cluster state. If conditions change (e.g., a Node becomes overloaded or unavailable), the scheduler may re-evaluate pending Pods or assist in rescheduling to maintain optimal cluster performance.

- **Dynamic Adjustments**:  
  This ongoing process ensures that the cluster remains balanced and that Pods are distributed in a manner that optimizes resource utilization and adheres to defined policies.

---

This workflow guarantees that the scheduling decisions are made in a systematic, efficient manner, ensuring high availability, balanced resource utilization, and adherence to defined constraints across the Kubernetes cluster.
