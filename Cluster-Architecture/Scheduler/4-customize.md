# **4. Customizing the Scheduler**

Kubernetes provides flexibility to customize scheduling behavior to suit specific workload requirements. This section outlines how to configure the default scheduler, use a custom scheduler, and extend scheduler functionality through a scheduler extender.

---

## **4.1 Configuring the Default Scheduler**

- **Overview**:  
  The default Kubernetes scheduler comes with several built-in configurations and policies that can be adjusted to fine-tune scheduling behavior.

- **Configuration Options**:  
  - **Policy Configuration**: You can provide a scheduler policy configuration file (usually in JSON format) to define scoring priorities, weight settings, and filtering rules.
  - **Flags and Command-Line Options**: The scheduler supports various command-line flags to modify its behavior (e.g., `--policy-config-file`, `--kube-api-qps`, `--kube-api-burst`).

- **Example**:  
  A basic policy configuration might specify custom priorities for node selection:
```json
  {
    "kind": "Policy",
    "apiVersion": "v1",
    "predicates": [
      {"name": "PodFitsResources"},
      {"name": "PodFitsHostPorts"}
    ],
    "priorities": [
      {
        "name": "LeastRequestedPriority",
        "weight": 1
      },
      {
        "name": "BalancedResourceAllocation",
        "weight": 1
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
  Configure the scheduler to use this file by passing:
```sh
  kube-scheduler --policy-config-file=/path/to/policy.json
  ```

- **Use Cases**:  
  Adjusting default scheduler settings is useful for environments with unique resource constraints or when the default scoring mechanisms need fine-tuning to match specific workload requirements.

## **4.2 Using a Custom Scheduler**

- **Overview**:  
  In some cases, the default scheduler may not fully address all specific scheduling requirements. A custom scheduler can be developed and deployed alongside the default scheduler to handle specialized workloads.

- **Deployment**:  
  - A custom scheduler is implemented as a separate process and registered with the Kubernetes API.  
  - Pods can be configured to use a custom scheduler by setting the `schedulerName` field in their pod specification.

- **Example**:  
  Pod specification using a custom scheduler:
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
  metadata:
    name: custom-scheduler-pod
  spec:
    schedulerName: my-custom-scheduler
    containers:
      - name: my-app
        image: nginx
        ports:
          - containerPort: 80
  ```
  The custom scheduler should be configured to watch for Pods with `schedulerName: my-custom-scheduler` and handle their scheduling accordingly.

- **Use Cases**:  
  Custom schedulers are particularly useful when:
  - Specialized scheduling logic is needed (e.g., prioritizing specific workloads).
  - Integration with external systems or advanced scheduling algorithms is required.
  - Segregating workloads between the default and custom scheduler to meet distinct SLAs.

## **4.3 Scheduler Extender**

- **Overview**:  
  A scheduler extender allows external systems to participate in the scheduling decision process. Extenders can add additional filtering and scoring steps beyond what the default scheduler provides.

- **Functionality**:  
  - **Filtering**: Extenders can filter out nodes that do not meet custom criteria before the default scheduling process makes its decision.
  - **Scoring**: Extenders can contribute additional scores to nodes based on external metrics or policies.

- **Example**:  
  An extender is typically implemented as a web service that receives scheduling requests from the scheduler. The scheduler can be configured with the extender's endpoint using command-line parameters or a configuration file.
  ```json
  {
    "kind": "Policy",
    "apiVersion": "v1",
    "extenders": [
      {
        "urlPrefix": "http://extender-service.namespace.svc.cluster.local:12345",
        "filterVerb": "filter",
        "prioritizeVerb": "prioritize",
        "weight": 5,
        "enableHttps": false,
        "nodeCacheCapable": true,
        "ignorable": false
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
  This configuration instructs the scheduler to call the extender service to filter and score nodes during the scheduling process.

- **Use Cases**:  
  Scheduler extenders are beneficial when:
  - There is a need to incorporate custom business logic or external data sources (e.g., power consumption metrics, specialized hardware availability).
  - Enhancing the default scheduling process without replacing it entirely.
  - Creating a hybrid scheduling system that combines Kubernetesâ€™ built-in logic with external evaluations.

Customizing the scheduler, whether by configuring the default one, implementing a custom scheduler, or using scheduler extenders, enables Kubernetes administrators to tailor Pod placement to meet unique and advanced workload requirements, ensuring optimal performance and resource utilization across the cluster.
