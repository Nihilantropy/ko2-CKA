### **1. Why Use Multiple or Custom Schedulers?**  

Kubernetes comes with a default scheduler that efficiently places Pods onto nodes based on resource availability, constraints, and policies. However, in certain scenarios, using multiple schedulers or a custom scheduler can be more optimal.  

#### **1.1 Limitations of the Default Kubernetes Scheduler**  
- The default scheduler uses a **generalized algorithm** that may not fit specific workload requirements.  
- It lacks deep customization for **prioritizing certain Pods** beyond predefined scheduling policies.  
- It may **not handle specialized workloads efficiently**, such as machine learning jobs, real-time applications, or batch processing.  

#### **1.2 Benefits of Multiple Schedulers**  
- **Workload Isolation:** Different schedulers can handle different types of workloads (e.g., one for batch jobs, another for latency-sensitive applications).  
- **Improved Scheduling Efficiency:** Custom schedulers can optimize resource allocation for specific workloads.  
- **Failover and Redundancy:** Running multiple schedulers ensures scheduling continues even if one scheduler fails.  
- **Better Support for Custom Policies:** Custom rules for node selection, priority, and preemption can be applied.  

#### **1.3 When to Use a Custom Scheduler**  
- When you need **custom scheduling logic**, such as placing Pods based on external metrics.  
- When running **specialized workloads** like GPU-based machine learning, real-time data processing, or latency-sensitive applications.  
- When optimizing **cost and resource efficiency** by implementing a scheduler tailored to a clusterâ€™s workload.  
- When using **multi-tenant clusters**, where different teams require different scheduling strategies.
