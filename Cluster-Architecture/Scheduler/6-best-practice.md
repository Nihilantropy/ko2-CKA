# **6. Best Practices for Scheduling Optimization**  

Optimizing scheduling in Kubernetes ensures efficient resource utilization, high availability, and balanced workloads across the cluster. Implementing best practices helps improve application performance, reduce latency, and enhance overall cluster stability.

## **6.1 Efficient Resource Allocation**  

- **Define Requests and Limits Properly**  
  Setting appropriate CPU and memory **requests** ensures the scheduler places Pods on Nodes that meet their resource needs. **Limits** prevent a single Pod from consuming excessive resources.  
  ```yaml
  resources:
    requests:
      cpu: "250m"
      memory: "256Mi"
    limits:
      cpu: "500m"
      memory: "512Mi"
  ```
  
- **Use Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA)**  
  Dynamically adjust Pod resource requests based on actual usage to optimize scheduling and avoid over-provisioning.  
```sh
  kubectl apply -f vpa.yaml
  ```

- **Implement Resource Quotas and Limit Ranges**  
  Prevent resource monopolization by enforcing quotas at the namespace level:  
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: ResourceQuota
  metadata:
    name: namespace-quota
    namespace: dev
  spec:
    hard:
      requests.cpu: "2"
      requests.memory: "4Gi"
      limits.cpu: "4"
      limits.memory: "8Gi"
  ```

## **6.2 Managing High Availability Scheduling**  

- **Use Pod Affinity and Anti-Affinity Rules**  
  Ensure application availability by spreading workloads across Nodes, zones, or regions.  
  ```yaml
  affinity:
    podAntiAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        - labelSelector:
            matchExpressions:
              - key: app
                operator: In
                values:
                  - frontend
          topologyKey: "kubernetes.io/hostname"
  ```
  This configuration prevents multiple replicas from running on the same Node, increasing fault tolerance.

- **Distribute Critical Services Across Zones**  
  When running a multi-zone cluster, use **topology-aware scheduling** to distribute Pods across zones for redundancy.  
  ```yaml
  topologySpreadConstraints:
    - maxSkew: 1
      topologyKey: "topology.kubernetes.io/zone"
      whenUnsatisfiable: ScheduleAnyway
      labelSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: web-server
  ```

- **Use Multiple Schedulers for Different Workloads**  
  Assign different workloads to custom schedulers tailored for specific performance needs.

## **6.3 Load Balancing Across Nodes**  

- **Enable Pod Disruption Budgets (PDBs)**  
  Prevent excessive disruptions during maintenance or Node failures by setting a Pod Disruption Budget:  
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: policy/v1
  kind: PodDisruptionBudget
  metadata:
    name: web-pdb
  spec:
    minAvailable: 2
    selector:
      matchLabels:
        app: web-server
  ```

- **Utilize Cluster Autoscaler**  
  Dynamically scale worker Nodes based on demand to maintain optimal scheduling efficiency.  
```sh
  kubectl scale deployment my-app --replicas=5
  ```

- **Balance Workloads Using Scheduler Preferences**  
  Use **Node Affinity Preferences** to favor certain Nodes without strictly enforcing scheduling constraints:  
  ```yaml
  affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
      preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        - weight: 1
          preference:
            matchExpressions:
              - key: node-type
                operator: In
                values:
                  - high-performance
  ```

By following these best practices, Kubernetes administrators can optimize scheduling, improve application reliability, and ensure efficient resource distribution across the cluster.
