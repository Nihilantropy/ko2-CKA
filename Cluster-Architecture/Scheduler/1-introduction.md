# **1. Introduction to Kubernetes Scheduler**  

## **1.1 What is the Scheduler?**  

The **Kubernetes Scheduler** is a core control plane component responsible for **assigning Pods to Nodes** based on resource availability, constraints, and scheduling policies. It ensures that workloads are distributed efficiently across the cluster while considering factors such as resource requests, affinity rules, and taints.  

Without a scheduler, Pods would remain in a **pending** state indefinitely, as no automated process would assign them to worker nodes.

## **1.2 Role of the Scheduler in Kubernetes**  

The scheduler plays a critical role in ensuring **efficient resource utilization and workload distribution**. Its primary responsibilities include:  

- **Pod Assignment**: Assigns unscheduled Pods to suitable Nodes based on scheduling constraints and resource availability.  
- **Resource Management**: Ensures Pods are scheduled on Nodes with enough CPU, memory, and storage resources.  
- **Policy Enforcement**: Implements scheduling policies such as **node affinity**, **anti-affinity**, and **taints and tolerations**.  
- **Cluster Balancing**: Distributes workloads to maintain cluster health and prevent resource contention.
