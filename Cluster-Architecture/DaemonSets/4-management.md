### **4. Creating and Managing DaemonSets**

#### **Creating a DaemonSet from a YAML Manifest**
To create a DaemonSet in Kubernetes, you typically define its specification in a YAML file. This manifest contains the configuration for the DaemonSet, including the Pod template, node selectors, affinity, tolerations, and other scheduling constraints. The YAML file is then applied using `kubectl` to create the DaemonSet.

Here is an example of a basic DaemonSet YAML manifest:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: example-daemonset
  namespace: default
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: example
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: example
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: example-container
        image: example-image:v1
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "64Mi"
            cpu: "250m"
          limits:
            memory: "128Mi"
            cpu: "500m"
```

In this example:
- The DaemonSet ensures that a Pod with the container `example-container` runs on every node in the cluster.
- The Pod specification includes resource requests and limits for CPU and memory.
- The `selector` field ensures the DaemonSet targets Pods with the label `app: example`.

To create the DaemonSet from the manifest, use the following `kubectl` command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f daemonset.yaml
```

This command applies the YAML manifest, which instructs Kubernetes to create the DaemonSet according to the specified configuration.

#### **Managing DaemonSets with `kubectl`**
Once a DaemonSet has been created, it can be managed using `kubectl` commands to view, update, and delete the DaemonSet. Here are some useful commands for managing DaemonSets:

1. **Listing DaemonSets**:
   To list all DaemonSets in a specific namespace (or the default namespace if none is provided), use the following command:
   
   ```bash
   kubectl get daemonsets -n <namespace>
   ```

   Example:

   ```bash
   kubectl get daemonsets -n default
   ```

2. **Describing a DaemonSet**:
   To get more detailed information about a DaemonSet, including the number of Pods it is managing, use the `describe` command:
   
   ```bash
   kubectl describe daemonset <daemonset-name> -n <namespace>
   ```

   Example:

   ```bash
   kubectl describe daemonset example-daemonset -n default
   ```

   This will show the DaemonSet's status, including the number of Pods running and any relevant events.

3. **Viewing DaemonSet Pods**:
   To see the Pods managed by a DaemonSet, use the `get pods` command with a label selector that matches the DaemonSet:
   
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -l app=<label-selector> -n <namespace>
   ```

   Example:

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -l app=example -n default
   ```

4. **Deleting a DaemonSet**:
   To delete a DaemonSet, use the `delete` command:
   
   ```bash
   kubectl delete daemonset <daemonset-name> -n <namespace>
   ```

   Example:

   ```bash
   kubectl delete daemonset example-daemonset -n default
   ```

   This will delete the DaemonSet and all the Pods it manages.

#### **Scaling and Updating DaemonSets**
Unlike Deployments, which manage a specific number of Pods, a DaemonSet ensures that one Pod runs on every eligible node in the cluster. However, there are still some ways to "scale" or adjust the behavior of a DaemonSet.

1. **Scaling DaemonSets (Number of Nodes)**:
   The scaling of DaemonSets is indirectly done by adjusting the number of nodes in the cluster. Since the DaemonSet is designed to run one Pod per node, if you add or remove nodes from the cluster, the DaemonSet will automatically create or remove Pods accordingly. This ensures that the number of Pods always matches the number of available nodes.

2. **Updating DaemonSets**:
   To update a DaemonSet, you modify the DaemonSet's YAML definition, and then apply the changes using `kubectl apply`. This could include changing container images, resource requests, labels, or any other configurations. Kubernetes performs a rolling update of Pods managed by the DaemonSet, ensuring that Pods are updated one by one without any downtime.

   Example of updating a container image in the DaemonSet manifest:

   ```yaml
   spec:
     template:
       spec:
         containers:
         - name: example-container
           image: example-image:v2  # Updated image
   ```

   After modifying the YAML file, apply the updated configuration:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f daemonset.yaml
   ```

   Kubernetes will perform a rolling update, and the new version of the container will be deployed to the Pods managed by the DaemonSet.

3. **Rolling Update Strategy**:
   DaemonSets support rolling updates, which means that when an update is applied, Kubernetes gradually replaces the Pods with the new specification. You can configure the update strategy in the DaemonSet spec, such as defining the number of Pods that can be updated at a time:

   ```yaml
   spec:
     updateStrategy:
       type: RollingUpdate
       rollingUpdate:
         maxUnavailable: 1
   ```

   This example specifies that at most one Pod can be unavailable at a time during the update.

4. **DaemonSet Update Triggers**:
   DaemonSets can be updated in response to changes in the Pod template. If a change is made to a field within the Pod template, such as updating the container image or modifying resource requests, Kubernetes triggers a Pod replacement process to ensure the update is applied to all nodes.

#### **Summary**
Creating and managing DaemonSets in Kubernetes is straightforward using YAML manifests and `kubectl` commands. DaemonSets are particularly useful for deploying applications that must run on every node, such as monitoring agents, logging daemons, or other system-level applications. The lifecycle of DaemonSets can be easily controlled through scaling and updating mechanisms, including rolling updates for seamless transitions between versions. Kubernetes ensures that Pods are distributed across nodes, and with the use of advanced scheduling features like node affinity and tolerations, you can control exactly where and when your DaemonSet Pods are deployed.
