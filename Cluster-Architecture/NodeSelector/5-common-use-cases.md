### 5. **Common Use Cases for NodeSelector**

#### **Assigning Pods to Specific Node Types**

NodeSelector can be used to assign Pods to nodes with specific hardware capabilities, such as GPU-enabled nodes, high-memory nodes, or nodes with special configurations. For example, you can schedule machine learning Pods on GPU nodes by labeling those nodes with `gpu=true`.

#### **Node Affinity and NodeSelector Comparison**

NodeSelector is a simpler method for node selection, but if you need more advanced scheduling features (e.g., operators such as `In`, `NotIn`, `Exists`), consider using **Node Affinity** (which is a more advanced feature). Node Affinity allows for a more flexible and powerful way to express rules for node selection, beyond the simple equality of NodeSelector.

#### **Use in Multi-Tenant Environments**

In multi-tenant environments, NodeSelector is useful for isolating workloads from different tenants on specific nodes. You can label nodes by tenant or environment (e.g., `tenant=tenant1`) and use NodeSelector to assign Pods to those nodes, ensuring workload isolation.
