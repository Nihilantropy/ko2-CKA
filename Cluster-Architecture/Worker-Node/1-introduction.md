# 1️⃣ Introduction to Worker Nodes

## What is a Worker Node?

A **Worker Node** is a fundamental component of a Kubernetes cluster that is responsible for running containerized workloads. It provides the necessary compute resources to run Pods and ensures that applications deployed in Kubernetes function correctly.

Each worker node runs a set of essential services that allow it to communicate with the control plane and manage containerized applications.

## Worker Node Responsibilities in Kubernetes

Worker nodes are designed to handle the execution of application workloads. Their primary responsibilities include:

- **Running Pods**: Worker nodes host and execute Pods, which contain one or more containers.
- **Interfacing with the Control Plane**: They receive workload assignments from the Kubernetes API server.
- **Networking & Service Discovery**: Worker nodes facilitate pod-to-pod and external communications.
- **Managing Container Lifecycle**: Using the container runtime, worker nodes start, stop, and maintain containers.
- **Resource Allocation & Scaling**: They handle CPU, memory, and storage allocation for running applications.

## Worker Node vs. Control Plane

A Kubernetes cluster consists of both **control plane nodes** and **worker nodes**. Understanding their differences is crucial:

| Feature                 | Worker Node                            | Control Plane Node                              |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Primary Function        | Runs workloads (Pods, containers)      | Manages the cluster and scheduling              |
| Key Components          | Kubelet, Container Runtime, Kube Proxy | API Server, Scheduler, Controller Manager, etc. |
| Workload Execution      | Yes                                    | No (except in single-node clusters)             |
| Direct User Interaction | Limited (managed by Control Plane)     | Full management via kubectl/API                 |

In summary, **worker nodes are responsible for running applications**, while the **control plane handles cluster management and orchestration**.
