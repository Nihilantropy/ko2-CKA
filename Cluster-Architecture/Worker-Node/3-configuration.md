# 3️⃣ Worker Node Configurations

Configuring a worker node correctly is essential for efficient resource utilization, security, and stability within a Kubernetes cluster. This section covers key configuration aspects of a worker node.

---

## **Node Registration & Labels**

### Registering a Worker Node

A worker node must be registered with the Kubernetes control plane before it can schedule and run workloads. This registration process involves:

- Kubelet starting on the worker node.
- The node contacting the API server.
- The API server verifying the node and adding it to the cluster.

### Node Labels & Taints

- **Labels**: Key-value pairs assigned to nodes that help with scheduling decisions (e.g., `node-role.kubernetes.io/worker=true`).
- **Taints**: Prevent specific workloads from being scheduled on a node unless a corresponding **toleration** is present in the Pod definition.

---

## **Resource Allocation & Limits**

Worker nodes have finite resources (CPU, memory, and storage). Proper configuration ensures optimal utilization and prevents resource exhaustion.

### Setting Resource Limits for Worker Nodes

- **CPU & Memory Requests**: Define the minimum guaranteed resources for a Pod.
- **CPU & Memory Limits**: Set maximum resource usage per Pod to avoid excessive consumption.

These settings can be managed using **ResourceQuotas** and **LimitRanges** at the namespace level.

## **Networking Configuration**

A worker node's network configuration determines how Pods communicate within the cluster and with external systems.

### Key Network Configurations:

1. **Pod Network (CNI Plugin)**:
   - Worker nodes use a Container Network Interface (**CNI**) plugin (e.g., Flannel, Calico, Cilium) to assign IP addresses to Pods.
   - CNI ensures inter-Pod communication across nodes.
2. **Kube Proxy Mode**:
   - Determines how services are exposed within the cluster (`iptables` or `IPVS` mode).
3. **NodePort & External Access**:
   - Configuring NodePort services allows external traffic to access workloads running on worker nodes.

---

## **Security & Authentication**

Security best practices help protect worker nodes from unauthorized access and malicious activities.

### Key Security Configurations:

- **Kubelet Authentication & Authorization**:
  - Secure the Kubelet API to restrict access.
  - Enable **Webhook authentication** for fine-grained control.
- **Pod Security Context**:
  - Configure worker nodes to enforce security policies on running Pods (e.g., disallow privileged containers).
- **RBAC & Node Authorization**:
  - Role-Based Access Control (**RBAC**) ensures users and components have the correct permissions.
  - **Node Authorization** restricts worker nodes from accessing resources they don’t own.

Properly configuring worker nodes ensures optimal performance, stability, and security within a Kubernetes cluster. Next, we will cover **Worker Node Communication & Networking** to dive deeper into inter-node connectivity.
