## 1. **Introduction to Admission Controllers**

### What are Admission Controllers?

**Admission Controllers** are a crucial component of the Kubernetes control plane, responsible for intercepting and regulating requests to the Kubernetes API server. They evaluate and modify incoming requests before they are persisted to the clusterâ€™s etcd database. Admission Controllers can perform various tasks such as validating resources, mutating configurations, enforcing security policies, and preventing certain operations from being executed. Essentially, they act as gatekeepers for ensuring that all resources within the cluster comply with specified rules.

Admission Controllers work during the following phases:
- **Mutating Admission**: Modifies incoming requests (e.g., automatically adding default values to resource specifications).
- **Validating Admission**: Validates that the request adheres to the defined policies (e.g., ensuring a pod does not exceed resource limits or ensuring certain labels are present).

Kubernetes employs **two main types** of Admission Controllers:
- **Mutating Admission Controllers**: Modify the request before it is persisted.
- **Validating Admission Controllers**: Validate the request and determine whether it should proceed or be rejected.

### Types of Admission Controllers

Admission Controllers come in two primary categories:
- **Mutating Admission Controllers**: These controllers can modify the content of incoming API requests before they are committed to the cluster. For example, they can automatically inject default values for fields like labels, resource requests, or annotations.
  
  Example: The `MutatingAdmissionWebhook` controller can mutate incoming requests by adding or modifying labels based on predefined rules.

- **Validating Admission Controllers**: These controllers are designed to validate incoming requests. They ensure that the resources being created, updated, or deleted comply with specific policies or rules. If a request fails validation, it is rejected, preventing the API server from performing the operation.
  
  Example: The `ValidatingAdmissionWebhook` controller can enforce policies like ensuring that only authorized users can create or modify resources, or ensuring that certain security labels are present on all pods.

### Importance of Admission Controllers in Kubernetes

Admission Controllers play an essential role in Kubernetes security, governance, and automation by enabling cluster administrators to enforce rules and standards across the cluster. These controllers allow for more fine-grained control over how resources are created, modified, and interacted with.

The benefits of Admission Controllers include:
- **Security**: They can enforce strict security policies, preventing unauthorized actions or the deployment of potentially insecure resources.
- **Policy Enforcement**: Admission Controllers help ensure that all resources in the cluster follow organization-specific rules, such as the use of certain labels or the requirement to have resource limits.
- **Automation**: Admission Controllers can automatically apply default settings or modifications to resources (e.g., adding labels, annotations, or security configurations) to ensure consistency across the cluster.
- **Compliance**: They can enforce organizational compliance by ensuring that deployed resources meet legal, regulatory, or internal standards before being committed to the cluster.

Overall, Admission Controllers are an important tool for securing and managing Kubernetes clusters by providing enforcement points for various policies and automating common tasks, making Kubernetes clusters more predictable, reliable, and compliant.
