## 8. **Debugging Admission Controllers**

Debugging admission controllers in Kubernetes is essential for ensuring that custom policies are functioning correctly and that unexpected issues do not disrupt cluster operations. Admission controllers act as gatekeepers, and if something goes wrong, it could result in resource creation or modification failures, leaving the cluster in an inconsistent state. In this section, we’ll explore how to debug admission controllers by focusing on logging and monitoring activities, troubleshooting common issues, and using tools and techniques for effective debugging.

### **Logging and Monitoring Admission Controller Activities**

Effective logging and monitoring are crucial for understanding the behavior of admission controllers and diagnosing issues. Logs can reveal important information about why a resource was admitted or denied, helping administrators track down problems and understand webhook activity.

#### **1. Enabling Webhook Logs**

For webhooks, the logs generated by the webhook server are the first line of debugging. Depending on how the webhook server is configured (e.g., running as a pod inside the cluster), you can view the logs using `kubectl`:

```bash
kubectl logs -f pod/webhook-server-xyz -n default
```

If the webhook server is not producing enough logs, consider increasing the logging verbosity or adding more detailed logging within the webhook code.

#### **2. Kubernetes API Server Logs**

The Kubernetes API server logs contain important information about the requests it is processing and interacting with admission controllers. If something goes wrong in the admission process, the API server logs will usually provide error messages or warnings related to admission controller failures.

You can access the API server logs if you have access to the master node or through your cloud provider's logging services. For on-prem Kubernetes clusters, this may involve viewing logs directly from systemd or container logs:

```bash
journalctl -u kube-apiserver
```

Look for log entries related to admission webhook requests, such as:
- **Admission webhook call errors**.
- **Webhook timeouts**.
- **Rejected admission requests**.

#### **3. Kubernetes Audit Logs**

Audit logs provide detailed records of every API request, including the admission control decision. Kubernetes audit logs can help track down the source of failed resource creation or modification and provide insights into why a resource was denied or mutated.

Audit logs can be enabled in the Kubernetes API server by specifying the `--audit-log-path` parameter in the API server configuration. Once enabled, you can analyze these logs to see how admission controllers responded to specific requests.

Example log entry for a denied pod creation request:
```json
{
  "user": "admin",
  "verb": "create",
  "objectRef": {
    "resource": "pods",
    "name": "my-pod"
  },
  "responseStatus": {
    "code": 403
  },
  "reason": "Admission webhook rejected the request"
}
```

### **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

When troubleshooting admission controllers, there are several common issues that could arise. Below are some typical problems and strategies for identifying and resolving them:

#### **1. Webhook Timeout Issues**

Webhook timeouts are a common issue, especially when dealing with external webhooks or services with high latency. If a webhook takes too long to respond, the Kubernetes API server will cancel the request, which can result in the admission control process failing.

- **Diagnosis**: If you encounter frequent timeouts, check the webhook server's logs for delays in processing, or verify whether the server is under heavy load.
- **Resolution**: Ensure the webhook service is properly scaled to handle incoming requests, optimize the server code for faster responses, or improve the network connectivity between the API server and the webhook service.

#### **2. Invalid or Missing CA Certificate**

If the Kubernetes API server cannot verify the webhook’s SSL certificate, the admission control webhook will fail to communicate with the server. This can happen if the `caBundle` in the webhook configuration is incorrect or missing.

- **Diagnosis**: Check the webhook configuration for correct `caBundle` values. If the webhook server uses a self-signed certificate, ensure the `caBundle` field in the webhook configuration contains the correct CA certificate.
- **Resolution**: If using a self-signed certificate, ensure the Kubernetes API server has the correct CA certificate. Update the `caBundle` field in the webhook configuration if necessary.

#### **3. Webhook Rejects Resources Incorrectly**

Sometimes, admission controllers, especially custom ones, can reject resources based on incorrect logic. For example, a validating webhook may mistakenly reject a valid resource because the policy was misconfigured.

- **Diagnosis**: Look at the admission webhook server logs for any errors in the validation logic. Review the admission webhook's configuration and ensure that the logic being applied is correct.
- **Resolution**: Adjust the logic of the webhook to properly handle edge cases, or modify the configuration to better align with the desired behavior. Test webhook logic with different test cases to ensure it behaves correctly.

#### **4. Admission Webhook Fails to Process Mutations**

For mutating admission webhooks, there can be issues with the logic that mutates a resource before it is persisted. If the webhook does not correctly modify the resource, the changes might not be applied as expected.

- **Diagnosis**: Check webhook logs to verify that the mutation logic is executing as expected. Inspect the mutated resource to see if it contains the expected changes.
- **Resolution**: If the mutation logic is failing, inspect the code for errors in how the resource is being mutated. Make sure that the resource mutation logic matches the format expected by the Kubernetes API server.

### **Tools and Techniques for Debugging**

There are several tools and techniques that can help with debugging admission controllers:

#### **1. kubectl Dry Run**

Kubernetes provides a `--dry-run` flag that simulates a resource creation or modification without actually making changes. This can be useful for testing how admission controllers would respond to a particular request.

For example, you can use `kubectl` to test whether a pod creation would pass or fail the admission control:

```bash
kubectl create -f pod.yaml --dry-run=client
```

This will show you whether the resource passes the validation checks, helping you determine if admission controllers are causing the failure.

#### **2. Test Admission Webhook Using curl**

You can use `curl` or other HTTP clients to manually test the webhook endpoints. This can help you verify if the webhook is responding correctly and if the Kubernetes API server can communicate with it properly.

```bash
curl -X POST -d '{"kind":"AdmissionReview", "apiVersion":"admission.k8s.io/v1", ...}' https://webhook-server.default.svc.cluster.local
```

Make sure the webhook server is accessible and is processing the admission request as expected.

#### **3. Kubernetes API Server `--audit` Logs**

Enabling Kubernetes audit logs is a powerful debugging tool to track down the source of failed admission control decisions. The audit logs can provide detailed records of every API request, including admission webhook call results.

Example:

```bash
kubectl logs -f -n kube-system kube-apiserver-xyz
```

Look for records related to admission webhook decisions, such as errors, timeouts, or rejections.

#### **4. Enable Admission Controller Debugging in Logs**

For certain built-in admission controllers, you can enable debugging or increase the verbosity of the logs to gain more detailed insights into the actions taken by the admission controllers.

```bash
kubectl logs -f -n kube-system kube-apiserver --v=4
```

Setting the verbosity to a higher level can give you a more granular view of the actions taken by each admission controller.

### **Conclusion**

Debugging admission controllers requires a combination of proper logging, careful examination of the configuration, and troubleshooting of common issues such as timeouts, certificate errors, or incorrect webhook logic. By utilizing Kubernetes' powerful debugging tools and carefully reviewing webhook logs, administrators can quickly identify the root cause of issues and resolve them to ensure smooth operation of admission controllers in the cluster. By regularly monitoring and testing admission controllers, administrators can improve cluster security, compliance, and reliability.
