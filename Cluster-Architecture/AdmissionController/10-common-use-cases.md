## 10. **Use Cases for Admission Controllers**

Admission controllers are a vital component of Kubernetes that help enforce policies, constraints, and configurations on resources before they are created, updated, or deleted. By leveraging admission controllers, administrators can ensure that the cluster operates under strict guidelines, improve security, and automate resource management. In this section, we’ll explore some common use cases for admission controllers that help Kubernetes users enforce policies, automate configurations, and enforce compliance and security standards.

### **Implementing Policies and Constraints**

Admission controllers can be used to implement a wide range of organizational policies, ensuring that resources meet defined standards before they are accepted by the cluster.

#### **1. Resource Quotas**

Administrators can use admission controllers to enforce resource quotas across namespaces, ensuring that certain limits on CPU, memory, and other resources are not exceeded.

- **Example Use Case**: An organization wants to limit the resource consumption of certain teams to avoid one team consuming excessive cluster resources. An admission controller can be used to ensure that every new resource creation or update is checked against the defined resource quotas.

- **How It Works**: The admission controller validates resource requests by comparing the requested resource consumption (e.g., CPU and memory) with the allowed limits set at the namespace level. If the request exceeds the limit, the resource will be rejected.

#### **2. Label and Annotation Enforcement**

Admission controllers can enforce that specific labels or annotations are present in all resources created within a cluster.

- **Example Use Case**: A company requires that all Pods created in the production environment must include a `team` label for resource tracking and management.

- **How It Works**: A validating admission controller checks incoming requests for the presence of specific labels or annotations and rejects any resources that don’t comply with the specified label constraints.

#### **3. Preventing Privileged Containers**

Admission controllers are critical for preventing the deployment of privileged containers, which pose a security risk by providing escalated access to the host system.

- **Example Use Case**: An organization wants to prevent any user from creating Pods with the `privileged` flag set, which can allow containers to gain root access to the host system.

- **How It Works**: A validating admission controller inspects the Pod's security context and rejects any Pods with the `privileged` flag enabled, preventing these potentially dangerous containers from running.

### **Automating Configuration Management**

Admission controllers play a key role in automating the management of configurations and maintaining a standardized environment across the cluster. They can automatically inject, modify, or validate configurations to ensure that all resources comply with the desired state.

#### **1. Automatic Sidecar Injection**

An admission controller can automatically inject sidecar containers into Pods when they are created, ensuring that all Pods have a specific sidecar (e.g., a logging or monitoring agent) without requiring users to manually configure it.

- **Example Use Case**: An organization wants to ensure that all Pods are automatically injected with a logging sidecar container, allowing them to send logs to a centralized logging system.

- **How It Works**: A mutating admission controller monitors Pod creation requests and automatically injects the necessary sidecar containers, updating the Pod definition before it is persisted.

#### **2. Injecting Configuration Files**

Admission controllers can be used to automatically inject configuration files or secrets into resources during their creation or modification. This ensures that applications receive the right configuration without requiring manual intervention.

- **Example Use Case**: A cluster administrator wants to ensure that every newly created application Pod gets the correct database configuration and secrets injected into the environment variables.

- **How It Works**: A mutating admission controller automatically injects the necessary environment variables or volumes containing the required configuration files or secrets into the Pod’s specification before the resource is persisted.

#### **3. Enforcing Consistent Namespace and Resource Defaults**

To ensure that new resources are configured correctly from the start, admission controllers can automatically apply default values for resources that lack specific configurations.

- **Example Use Case**: An organization wants all Pods to be created with a specific namespace and resource requests (e.g., CPU and memory) unless specified otherwise.

- **How It Works**: A mutating admission controller ensures that new Pods created without resource specifications have default resource requests and limits automatically applied.

### **Enforcing Compliance and Security Policies**

Admission controllers are integral for enforcing compliance and security policies within Kubernetes clusters, helping organizations meet regulatory standards and ensure that workloads meet security requirements.

#### **1. Pod Security Policies**

Admission controllers can enforce policies for Pod security to prevent insecure configurations, such as Pods running with root privileges or mounting sensitive host directories into containers.

- **Example Use Case**: A company needs to enforce a security policy that all containers must run as non-root users and must not mount sensitive host directories (e.g., `/etc`).

- **How It Works**: A validating admission controller enforces the Pod security policies, ensuring that Pods are only created if they meet the specified security configurations, such as a non-root user and safe volume mounts.

#### **2. Network Policy Enforcement**

Admission controllers can be used to ensure that new resources comply with network policies, preventing Pods from communicating with unauthorized resources or allowing unsafe network traffic.

- **Example Use Case**: An organization wants to prevent containers in a particular namespace from accessing external services or other namespaces unless explicitly permitted.

- **How It Works**: A validating admission controller checks if the Pods or Services comply with predefined network policies, ensuring that network traffic is restricted according to the organization’s security guidelines.

#### **3. Image Signing and Verification**

Admission controllers can enforce policies that require images to be signed by a trusted source. This ensures that only verified images are allowed to run in the cluster, reducing the risk of running malicious code.

- **Example Use Case**: A security policy mandates that only signed Docker images from a trusted registry should be deployed in the Kubernetes cluster.

- **How It Works**: A validating admission controller checks the image signature before allowing a Pod to be created. If the image is not signed or does not come from a trusted registry, the Pod creation request is rejected.

#### **4. Restricting API Server Access**

Admission controllers can enforce policies that limit access to sensitive resources based on users, roles, or namespaces. This ensures that only authorized users can create or modify certain types of resources.

- **Example Use Case**: A company wants to restrict certain users from creating or modifying resources in production namespaces.

- **How It Works**: A validating admission controller checks the identity of the requestor and the targeted namespace, ensuring that users are only allowed to interact with resources in authorized namespaces.

### **Conclusion**

Admission controllers provide a powerful mechanism for enforcing policies and constraints within Kubernetes clusters. They can automate configuration management, ensure consistent and secure environments, and prevent the deployment of insecure or non-compliant resources. By leveraging admission controllers for various use cases—such as enforcing resource quotas, injecting configuration files, and maintaining security policies—organizations can ensure that their Kubernetes environments are compliant, secure, and efficient. Implementing the right set of admission controllers will help safeguard the integrity of the cluster, improve operational efficiency, and maintain organizational standards.
