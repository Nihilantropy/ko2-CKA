# 6️⃣ Advanced Pod Concepts

Kubernetes provides a rich set of advanced concepts for managing Pods in complex and large-scale systems. This section explores these advanced Pod concepts, which include multi-container Pods, affinity & anti-affinity rules, pod disruptions, autoscaling, and taints & tolerations.

## Multi-Container Pods (Sidecars, Adapters, Ambassadors)

In Kubernetes, you can run multiple containers within a single Pod. These containers share the same network namespace and storage volumes, making it easier to manage related processes that must work together.

### 1. **Sidecars**

A **sidecar** container is used to support the main application container. It runs alongside the main container within the same Pod and provides supplementary functionality. Common use cases include logging, monitoring, and proxying.

**Example**: A sidecar container running a logging agent that collects logs from the main application container.

- **Use Cases**:
  - **Logging**: The sidecar container collects logs and forwards them to a logging service.
  - **Proxying**: The sidecar can serve as a reverse proxy for the main container.
  - **Monitoring**: The sidecar may run a health-check or metrics-gathering service for the main container.

### 2. **Adapters**

An **adapter** container is used to adapt one type of service or resource to another, typically for service communication or integration with external systems. Adapters are often used when the main application needs to communicate with a service or resource that requires additional configuration or protocol adaptation.

**Example**: An adapter container that transforms the format of messages between different services.

### 3. **Ambassadors**

An **ambassador** container acts as a proxy to an external service or system, usually handling network communication between the Pod and external resources. It can be used to manage communication with external databases or APIs.

**Example**: An ambassador container that handles communication with an external database while the main container interacts with it using standard interfaces.

### 4. **Benefits of Multi-Container Pods**

- Efficient resource sharing (network and storage).
- Simplified coordination between containers running the same application.
- Centralized management of related processes.

## Pod Affinity & Anti-Affinity

**Pod Affinity** and **Anti-Affinity** allow you to control where Pods are scheduled based on the location of other Pods in the cluster. These features help in optimizing resource utilization and maintaining application performance.

### 1. **Pod Affinity**

**Pod Affinity** allows you to schedule Pods on the same node or in close proximity to other Pods that share specific labels. This is useful when you want to ensure that Pods running related workloads are co-located for performance reasons.

**Example**: Schedule Pods of a specific app to run on the same node as other Pods of the same app for optimized communication.

```yaml
affinity:
  podAffinity:
    requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      - labelSelector:
          matchExpressions:
            - key: app
              operator: In
              values:
                - my-app
        topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
```

### 2. **Pod Anti-Affinity**

**Pod Anti-Affinity** prevents Pods from being scheduled on the same node or in close proximity to other Pods with specific labels. This is useful for spreading out Pods to reduce the risk of a failure affecting multiple Pods at the same time.

**Example**: Ensure that Pods running critical services are distributed across multiple nodes to avoid a single point of failure.

```yaml
affinity:
  podAntiAffinity:
    requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      - labelSelector:
          matchExpressions:
            - key: app
              operator: In
              values:
                - critical-app
        topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
```

## Pod Disruptions & Evictions

Kubernetes can automatically evict Pods during maintenance or scaling events, and disruption budgets allow you to control how much disruption is acceptable during these events.

### 1. **Pod Disruption Budgets (PDBs)**

A **Pod Disruption Budget** (PDB) defines the minimum number or percentage of Pods that must be available during voluntary disruptions, such as node upgrades or scaling down. It helps maintain application availability while allowing Kubernetes to manage Pods effectively during disruptions.

**Example**: Create a PDB that ensures at least 2 replicas of a Pod remain available during voluntary disruptions.

```yaml
apiVersion: policy/v1
kind: PodDisruptionBudget
metadata:
  name: my-pdb
spec:
  minAvailable: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
```

### 2. **Pod Evictions**

Kubernetes can evict Pods under certain conditions, such as resource shortages or node failures. Pod evictions can occur due to **resource constraints** (e.g., CPU, memory) or **node maintenance**.

- **Eviction due to resource pressure**: If a node runs out of resources (e.g., memory or disk space), Kubernetes may evict Pods to free up resources.
- **Eviction during upgrades**: When a node is being upgraded, Kubernetes can evict Pods to allow the upgrade to proceed smoothly.

Kubernetes tries to respect PDBs during evictions to avoid violating application availability.

## Horizontal & Vertical Pod Autoscaling

Kubernetes supports autoscaling Pods both horizontally and vertically, which enables the automatic adjustment of resources based on demand.

### 1. **Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)**

**Horizontal Pod Autoscaling** automatically adjusts the number of Pod replicas in response to observed CPU utilization or other custom metrics. HPA ensures that your application has enough replicas to handle increasing load while scaling down when demand is lower.

**Example**: Automatically scale the number of replicas based on CPU usage.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: my-container
          image: my-image
---
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: my-hpa
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: my-deployment
  minReplicas: 1
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
    - type: Resource
      resource:
        name: cpu
        target:
          type: Utilization
          averageUtilization: 80
```

### 2. **Vertical Pod Autoscaling (VPA)**

**Vertical Pod Autoscaling** adjusts the CPU and memory requests and limits for a Pod based on observed resource usage. VPA automatically resizes Pods to ensure that they have enough resources for their workload.

**Example**: Use VPA to adjust resource requests for a deployment based on usage trends.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: my-container
          image: my-image
          resources:
            requests:
              memory: "512Mi"
              cpu: "500m"
---
apiVersion: verticalpodautoscaler.k8s.io/v1
kind: VerticalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: my-vpa
spec:
  targetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: my-deployment
  updatePolicy:
    updateMode: "Auto"
```

## Taints & Tolerations (Pod scheduling restrictions)

**Taints** and **Tolerations** are used to control which Pods can be scheduled on which nodes in the cluster. They enable advanced scheduling mechanisms, such as isolating workloads or ensuring that certain Pods run only on specific nodes.

### 1. **Taints**

A **taint** is applied to a node to repel Pods that do not tolerate the taint. Taints allow nodes to repel Pods that are not designed to run on them.

**Example**: Apply a taint to a node that should only run specific types of Pods:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Node
metadata:
  name: node1
spec:
  taints:
    - effect: NoSchedule
      key: dedicated
      value: special-workload
```

### 2. **Tolerations**

A **toleration** is applied to a Pod to allow it to be scheduled on nodes with matching taints. Without a matching toleration, the Pod will not be scheduled on the tainted node.

**Example**: Apply a toleration to a Pod to schedule it on a node with a specific taint:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  tolerations:
    - key: dedicated
      operator: Equal
      value: special-workload
      effect: NoSchedule
```
