## **1. Introduction to Resource Requests and Limits**  

### **Definition and Purpose of Resource Requests and Limits**  
In Kubernetes, **Resource Requests and Limits** are mechanisms that control how CPU and memory are allocated to pods running within a cluster.  

- **Resource Requests**: Specify the minimum amount of CPU and memory a container needs to run. The Kubernetes scheduler uses these values to decide which node should host the pod.  
- **Resource Limits**: Define the maximum amount of CPU and memory a container can use. If a container exceeds these limits, Kubernetes may throttle its CPU usage or terminate it if it consumes too much memory.  

By setting appropriate requests and limits, users can ensure efficient resource utilization, prevent resource contention, and avoid unexpected application failures.  

### **Importance of Resource Management in Kubernetes**  
Efficient resource management in Kubernetes is critical for:  

- **Ensuring Fair Resource Distribution**: Prevents a single pod from consuming excessive resources and affecting other workloads.  
- **Optimizing Cluster Performance**: Helps distribute workloads evenly across nodes to avoid overloading or underutilization.  
- **Improving Application Stability**: Prevents pods from being evicted or throttled due to resource shortages.  
- **Enabling Autoscaling**: Kubernetes **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)** and **Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA)** rely on requests and limits for scaling decisions.  

Without proper resource requests and limits, Kubernetes may either **over-provision**, leading to wasted resources, or **under-provision**, causing performance issues and pod evictions.  

### **How Kubernetes Schedules Pods Based on Resource Requests**  
Kubernetes schedules pods based on **resource requests** using the following process:  

1. **Node Selection**:  
   - The **Kubernetes scheduler** looks for nodes with available resources that meet the podâ€™s **requested CPU and memory**.  
   - If no nodes have sufficient resources, the pod remains in a **Pending** state until resources become available.  

2. **Workload Distribution**:  
   - Kubernetes tries to distribute pods across nodes to balance resource usage.  
   - **Affinity rules, taints, and tolerations** may also influence scheduling decisions.  

3. **Resource Guarantees**:  
   - Once scheduled, the pod is guaranteed at least the requested CPU and memory.  
   - If the node runs out of resources, Kubernetes **evicts lower-priority pods** (BestEffort and Burstable QoS).  

By defining resource requests appropriately, users can ensure that their workloads are scheduled efficiently and prevent resource-related disruptions in their Kubernetes clusters.
