## 1. Overview  

### 1.1 Introduction to Kustomize  
Kustomize is a **native Kubernetes configuration management tool** that enables users to customize Kubernetes resource YAML files **without modifying the originals**. Unlike Helm, which uses templating, Kustomize operates on **declarative patches and overlays**, allowing for a more native and straightforward approach to Kubernetes configuration management.  

With Kustomize, users can:  
- Apply transformations like adding labels, annotations, or modifying fields.  
- Manage multiple environments (e.g., dev, staging, production) using overlays.  
- Generate Kubernetes ConfigMaps and Secrets dynamically.  
- Patch existing Kubernetes manifests without duplication.  

Kustomize is built into `kubectl`, making it a **lightweight, built-in solution** for Kubernetes deployments.

### 1.2 Why Use Kustomize?  
Kustomize provides a **declarative, native Kubernetes approach** to managing configurations. Key advantages include:  

#### **1. No Need to Modify Original YAMLs**  
Kustomize works **without modifying base manifests**, keeping the original Kubernetes resource files untouched. This improves maintainability and simplifies version control.  

#### **2. Environment-Specific Configurations**  
Using overlays, Kustomize allows users to manage multiple environments (e.g., development, testing, production) with **minimal duplication** and **clear separation** of configurations.  

#### **3. Native Kubernetes Compatibility**  
Unlike Helm, which introduces its own templating engine, Kustomize operates directly on standard Kubernetes YAML files, ensuring compatibility and reducing complexity.  

#### **4. Enhanced Customization Features**  
Kustomize offers built-in capabilities for:  
- **Patching resources** (Strategic Merge and JSON Patch).  
- **Generating ConfigMaps and Secrets** dynamically from local files or literals.  
- **Adding labels, annotations, prefixes, and suffixes** to resources without modifying YAML files.  

#### **5. Seamless Integration with GitOps and CI/CD**  
Since Kustomize is **declarative and file-based**, it integrates well with GitOps workflows (e.g., ArgoCD, FluxCD) and CI/CD pipelines.
