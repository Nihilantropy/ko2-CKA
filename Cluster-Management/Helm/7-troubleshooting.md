## 7. Troubleshooting

### 7.1 Debugging Templates Locally
- **Render Templates:**  
  Use the `helm template` command to render your chart templates locally and inspect the resulting Kubernetes manifests.  
  ```sh
  helm template my-release mychart/
  ```

- **Dry Run:**  
  Simulate an installation without actually deploying resources by using the `--dry-run` flag along with `--debug` to view detailed output.  
  ```sh
  helm install my-release mychart/ --dry-run --debug
  ```

- **Linting:**  
  Validate your chart's structure and syntax using the `helm lint` command, which checks for common issues and best practices.  
  ```sh
  helm lint mychart/
  ```

### 7.2 Checking the Status of a Release
- **Helm Status:**  
  Retrieve the current status of a Helm release to get details on its deployed resources and any potential issues.  
  ```sh
  helm status my-release
  ```

- **Kubernetes Resources:**  
  Use `kubectl` to inspect the status of resources created by the release. For example, list all resources with specific labels:  
  ```sh
  kubectl get all -l app=my-release
  ```

---

### 7.3 Reviewing Logs and Kubernetes Events
- **Pod Logs:**  
  Check the logs of individual pods to diagnose application-level errors or misconfigurations.  
  ```sh
  kubectl logs <pod-name>
  ```

- **Kubernetes Events:**  
  Review cluster events to identify warnings, errors, or other noteworthy occurrences that may affect the release.  
  ```sh
  kubectl get events
  ```

- **Helm History:**  
  Review the revision history of a release to understand past deployments and identify changes that may have introduced issues.  
  ```sh
  helm history my-release
  ```

### 7.4 Common Issues and Their Resolutions
- **Template Rendering Errors:**  
  - **Issue:** Errors during template rendering.  
  - **Resolution:** Use `helm lint` to identify syntax issues and validate that values in `values.yaml` are correctly formatted.

- **Deployment Failures:**  
  - **Issue:** Pods failing to start or deployments not rolling out correctly.  
  - **Resolution:** Check pod logs (`kubectl logs`) and Kubernetes events (`kubectl get events`) to identify misconfigurations or resource constraints.

- **Stale or Corrupt Releases:**  
  - **Issue:** An upgrade fails, leaving the release in an inconsistent state.  
  - **Resolution:** Use `helm rollback` to revert to a previous stable release.
  ```sh
  helm rollback my-release <revision>
  ```

- **Repository and Chart Issues:**  
  - **Issue:** Unable to fetch or update charts due to repository errors.  
  - **Resolution:** Verify repository URLs and update repositories using:
  ```sh
  helm repo update
  ```

- **Permission and RBAC Issues:**  
  - **Issue:** Helm or the deployed resources lack the necessary permissions.  
  - **Resolution:** Review and adjust Kubernetes RBAC policies to ensure that Helm and service accounts have the required access.
