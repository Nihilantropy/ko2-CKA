## 3. Helm Charts

### 3.1 What is a Helm Chart?
A Helm Chart is a package that encapsulates all of the resource definitions necessary to run an application, tool, or service on a Kubernetes cluster. Charts allow users to deploy pre-configured applications, manage upgrades, and roll back changes efficiently.

### 3.2 Anatomy of a Helm Chart

#### 3.2.1 Chart.yaml (Metadata)
- Contains metadata about the chart including the name, version, description, and maintainers.
- Defines chart dependencies and the required Kubernetes API version.

#### 3.2.2 values.yaml (Default Configurations)
- Holds the default configuration values for the chart.
- These values can be overridden by users during installation or upgrades.
- Provides a central location to customize chart behavior without modifying templates.

#### 3.2.3 Templates Directory (Kubernetes Manifests)
- Contains Kubernetes manifest templates that are rendered into standard Kubernetes YAML.
- Uses the Go templating engine to substitute configuration values from `values.yaml` or user-provided overrides.
- Includes definitions for deployments, services, config maps, secrets, and more.

#### 3.2.4 Charts Directory (Dependencies)
- Contains other Helm charts that are dependencies for the primary chart.
- Allows for modularization and reusability by packaging related charts together.
- Dependencies are managed within the chartâ€™s metadata.

#### 3.2.5 README.md (Documentation)
- Provides detailed documentation specific to the chart.
- Includes usage instructions, configuration details, and deployment guidelines.
- Acts as a guide for users to understand and effectively utilize the chart.
