# 5. Pod and Container Security

Ensuring the security of pods and containers is vital for maintaining a robust Kubernetes environment. This section covers best practices and built-in features to secure your workloads at the pod and container levels, including enforcing security policies, configuring secure runtime settings, managing container images, and protecting running applications from runtime threats.

## 5.1 Pod Security Standards and Policies

Pod security is enforced by applying policies that restrict the behavior and configuration of pods, reducing the risk of privilege escalation and ensuring proper isolation.

### 5.1.1 Pod Security Policies (Deprecated)

- **Overview:**  
  Pod Security Policies (PSPs) were originally designed to define a set of conditions that pods must meet in order to be accepted into the cluster. PSPs allowed administrators to enforce controls such as:
  - Running containers as non-root users.
  - Preventing privilege escalation.
  - Disallowing the use of host namespaces and hostPath volumes.
  - Restricting allowed Linux capabilities.

- **Key Points:**
  - **Configuration Complexity:** PSPs required careful crafting to balance security with functionality.
  - **RBAC Integration:** They were enforced through RBAC, with policies applied cluster-wide or per namespace.
  - **Deprecation:** PSPs are deprecated in favor of newer mechanisms, as they can be overly complex and hard to manage at scale.

- **Transition:**  
  Organizations are encouraged to transition to using Pod Security Admission controllers and Pod Security Standards for a more streamlined approach.

### 5.1.2 Pod Security Admission and Pod Security Standards

- **Overview:**  
  The Pod Security Admission controller enforces standardized security profiles at the time of pod creation. These profiles—namely Restricted, Baseline, and Privileged—provide a clear and consistent way to secure pods based on their intended use.

- **Security Profiles:**
  - **Restricted:**  
    Enforces the highest level of security. It disallows privileged containers, disallows host networking/IPC/PID, and requires running as non-root.
  - **Baseline:**  
    Provides a moderate security level, balancing security and ease of use. It allows some additional configurations but still restricts dangerous practices.
  - **Privileged:**  
    Allows pods to run with minimal security restrictions. This profile should only be used for trusted workloads requiring full host access.

- **Implementation:**  
  Assign the appropriate profile to namespaces using labels. For example, to enforce the restricted profile:
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Namespace
  metadata:
    name: secure-namespace
    labels:
      pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce: "restricted"
      pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce-version: "latest"
  ```
- **Advantages:**  
  - Simplifies policy enforcement compared to PSPs.
  - Reduces administrative overhead by using well-defined, community-vetted standards.
  - Provides clear guidance on which pods are permitted in different security contexts.

## 5.2 Security Context and Container Runtime Security

Security contexts allow administrators to define security-related settings for pods and containers. These settings help enforce isolation and limit the capabilities of processes running inside containers.

- **Pod-Level Security Context:**  
  Applies to all containers within a pod.
  - **runAsUser / runAsGroup:** Set the user and group ID under which containers execute.
  - **fsGroup:** Determines the group ownership of volumes mounted by the pod.

- **Container-Level Security Context:**  
  Overrides or augments pod-level settings for individual containers.
  - **allowPrivilegeEscalation:** Prevents processes from gaining additional privileges.
  - **capabilities:** Controls which Linux capabilities are added or dropped.
  - **readOnlyRootFilesystem:** Forces the container’s root filesystem to be read-only.
  - **seccompProfile:** Specifies a seccomp profile to restrict the system calls available to the container.

- **Example:**
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
  metadata:
    name: secure-pod
  spec:
    securityContext:
      runAsUser: 1000
      fsGroup: 2000
    containers:
    - name: secure-container
      image: my-secure-image
      securityContext:
        allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
        capabilities:
          drop: ["ALL"]
        readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
        seccompProfile:
          type: RuntimeDefault
  ```

- **Container Runtime Security:**  
  In addition to configuring security contexts, it’s important to ensure the container runtime is securely configured:
  - **Least Privilege:** Run the runtime with minimal privileges.
  - **Isolation:** Use Linux namespaces, cgroups, and security modules (e.g., SELinux, AppArmor) to isolate container processes.
  - **Regular Updates:** Keep the container runtime up-to-date with security patches.

## 5.3 Image Scanning and Vulnerability Management

Container images are a common attack vector. Scanning images for vulnerabilities and enforcing policies around image usage are essential components of Kubernetes security.

- **Static Image Scanning:**  
  Integrate image scanning tools (e.g., Trivy, Clair, Aqua Security) into the CI/CD pipeline to detect vulnerabilities before images are deployed.
  - **Example:**  
    ```bash
    trivy image my-secure-image:latest
    ```

- **Continuous Monitoring:**  
  Use tools that monitor deployed images and alert administrators when new vulnerabilities are discovered.
  
- **Admission Controls:**  
  Implement admission controllers or policies that reject images with known vulnerabilities or those that do not meet organizational security standards.

- **Immutable Image Tags:**  
  Encourage the use of immutable tags (e.g., specific versions or digests) to prevent unexpected changes.

- **Regular Updates:**  
  Continuously update images to incorporate security patches and new vulnerability mitigations.

## 5.4 Runtime Protection and Isolation

Runtime protection is focused on monitoring and securing containers while they are running in production, as vulnerabilities may be exploited after deployment.

- **Container Isolation Techniques:**  
  Use kernel features like namespaces, cgroups, SELinux, and AppArmor to isolate containers from each other and from the host system.

- **Runtime Monitoring:**  
  Deploy runtime security tools (e.g., Falco, Sysdig Secure, Aqua Security) that monitor container behavior in real time and detect suspicious activity.
  - **Example:**  
    Deploy Falco to watch for anomalous behavior:
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/falcosecurity/falco/master/kubernetes/falco.yaml
    ```

- **Intrusion Detection and Anomaly Detection:**  
  Implement systems that analyze container activity and network traffic to detect intrusions or abnormal behavior patterns.

- **Automated Response:**  
  Set up policies and workflows to automatically isolate or terminate containers if a security breach is detected. This may include integration with orchestration systems to restart compromised pods or notify administrators.

- **Logging and Forensics:**  
  Ensure comprehensive logging is in place to capture runtime events. Use these logs for forensic analysis if a security incident occurs.

By combining robust pod security standards, detailed security context configurations, proactive image scanning, and vigilant runtime monitoring, organizations can create a multi-layered defense strategy for their Kubernetes clusters. This approach minimizes the attack surface and provides the necessary controls to quickly detect and respond to security incidents within the containerized environment.
