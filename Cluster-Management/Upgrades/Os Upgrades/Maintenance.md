## 1. Overview

When performing an OS upgrade on a Kubernetes cluster node, it is essential to follow a systematic maintenance procedure. This minimizes downtime and prevents disruption of your workloads. The process typically involves:
- **Cordoning**: Preventing new pods from scheduling on the node.
- **Draining**: Evicting running pods from the node safely.
- **Upgrading the OS**: Performing the OS upgrade (e.g., patching or distribution upgrade).
- **Uncordoning**: Re-enabling the node for scheduling after upgrade.
- **Validation**: Ensuring that the node is back to a healthy state and that workloads are running correctly.

---

## 2. Pre-upgrade Checklist

Before beginning the OS upgrade, ensure you have completed the following:

- **Backup Critical Data**: Ensure that any important data or configuration files on the node are backed up.
- **Review Cluster Health**: Verify the overall health of the cluster.
  ```bash
  kubectl get nodes
  kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
  ```
- **Plan for Workload Distribution**: Confirm that remaining nodes can accommodate pods from the node being upgraded.
- **Communicate Downtime**: Inform stakeholders of the scheduled maintenance window.
- **Review Upgrade Instructions**: Ensure that the OS vendor’s documentation is available and understood.
- **Verify RBAC and Permissions**: Ensure you have cluster-admin privileges to execute maintenance commands.

## 3. Node Maintenance Procedures

### Cordoning a Node

Cordoning marks a node as unschedulable so that no new pods are scheduled on it. This is the first step before draining.

**Command:**
```bash
kubectl cordon <node-name>
```

**Example:**
```bash
kubectl cordon node-01
```

### Draining a Node

Draining safely evicts all pods from the node. Use the drain command with flags to ignore daemonsets and local data (emptyDir).

**Command:**
```bash
kubectl drain <node-name> --ignore-daemonsets --delete-emptydir-data
```

**Example:**
```bash
kubectl drain node-01 --ignore-daemonsets --delete-emptydir-data
```

> **Note:**  
> Draining a node will evict pods that are not managed by a higher-level controller (such as Deployments or ReplicaSets). Verify that critical pods are replicated or managed by a controller.

---

## 4. Performing the OS Upgrade

Once the node is cordoned and drained:

1. **SSH into the Node:**  
   Log in to the node using SSH:
   ```bash
   ssh user@<node-ip>
   ```

2. **Update the Package Repository and Upgrade OS Packages:**  
   Follow your distribution-specific commands. For example, on Ubuntu:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt upgrade -y
   ```
   Or for RHEL/CentOS:
   ```bash
   sudo yum update -y
   ```

3. **Reboot the Node (if required):**
   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```

4. **Wait for the Node to Reboot and Rejoin the Cluster:**
   Use your cloud provider’s console or SSH to confirm the node has rebooted and is ready for further operations.

---

## 5. Bringing the Node Back Online

After the OS upgrade, perform these steps to reintegrate the node into your cluster.

### Uncordoning a Node

Uncordon the node to mark it as schedulable, allowing new pods to be scheduled.

**Command:**
```bash
kubectl uncordon <node-name>
```

**Example:**
```bash
kubectl uncordon node-01
```

---

## 6. Post-upgrade Validation

Verify that the node is healthy and running the upgraded OS version:

- **Check Node Status:**
  ```bash
  kubectl get nodes
  ```
  Ensure that the upgraded node shows as `Ready`.

- **Review Pod Scheduling:**
  Confirm that new pods are scheduled on the node and that workloads are running correctly.
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o wide
  ```

- **Examine Node Logs:**
  Look for any errors in the node’s logs related to the upgrade.
  ```bash
  journalctl -u kubelet
  ```

---

## 7. Rolling Upgrades

For clusters with multiple nodes, perform the OS upgrade on nodes one at a time to maintain high availability. Follow these steps:
1. **Select a Node:**  
   Choose one node to upgrade.
2. **Cordoning and Draining:**  
   Execute the cordon and drain steps.
3. **Upgrade the Node:**  
   Perform the OS upgrade.
4. **Uncordon and Validate:**  
   Bring the node back online and validate.
5. **Repeat for Each Node:**  
   Continue the process for the remaining nodes.

> **Tip:**  
> Automate the process using scripts or tools like Ansible for clusters with a large number of nodes.

## 8. Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
- **Pods Stuck in Terminating State:**  
  Check for pods with finalizers or those not managed by a controller. Force deletion may be necessary:
  ```bash
  kubectl delete pod <pod-name> --grace-period=0 --force
  ```

- **Node Not Becoming Ready:**  
  Verify the kubelet service status on the node:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl status kubelet
  ```
  Review node logs for errors:
  ```bash
  journalctl -u kubelet
  ```

- **Workload Disruption:**  
  If workloads experience downtime, review scheduling and replica configurations. Consider increasing replica counts before maintenance.

---

## 9. Best Practices

- **Schedule Maintenance During Off-Peak Hours:**  
  Minimize impact on end users by scheduling upgrades during low-traffic periods.
  
- **Use Rolling Upgrades:**  
  Upgrade nodes one at a time to avoid cluster-wide downtime.
  
- **Monitor Cluster Health:**  
  Continuously monitor node and pod status during and after the upgrade.
  
- **Test Upgrades in a Staging Environment:**  
  Validate the OS upgrade process in a non-production environment to catch potential issues before affecting production workloads.
  
- **Document the Process:**  
  Maintain updated internal documentation of your node upgrade process for consistency and compliance.

- **Automate Where Possible:**  
  Use automation tools and scripts to reduce manual errors and improve repeatability.

## 10. Conclusion

Performing an OS upgrade in a Kubernetes cluster is a critical maintenance activity that must be executed carefully. By following the steps outlined in this document—cordoning and draining nodes, upgrading the OS, and uncordoning nodes—you can ensure a smooth upgrade process with minimal disruption to your workloads. Regular maintenance and adherence to best practices help keep your Kubernetes cluster secure, up-to-date, and highly available.
