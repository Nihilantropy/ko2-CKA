# Node-to-Node Networking in Kubernetes: Under the Hood

## 1. Introduction

In a Kubernetes cluster, not only must Pods communicate with each other, but the underlying nodes must also communicate effectively to deliver traffic between Pods located on different nodes. **Node-to-node networking** ensures that the network packets originating from a Pod on one node can reach their destination on another node, maintaining the cluster’s flat, routable network.

This documentation details the mechanisms behind node-to-node communication, explains what happens under the hood, and highlights the role of the Container Network Interface (CNI) plugins in orchestrating this process.

## 2. The Kubernetes Cluster Network Model

Kubernetes networking is built on a few core assumptions:
- **Every Pod gets a unique IP address** from a CIDR block allocated to the node.
- **Pods can communicate directly with any other Pod** in the cluster, regardless of which node they reside on.
- **Nodes are aware of each other’s Pod CIDRs** and can route traffic accordingly.

For node-to-node communication, these principles ensure that each node advertises its Pod IP ranges, allowing the cluster’s routing infrastructure to forward packets appropriately.

## 3. How Node-to-Node Communication Works

### 3.1 IP Addressing and Routing

- **Pod CIDR Allocation:**  
  Each node in the Kubernetes cluster is assigned a unique Pod CIDR (for example, Node A might have `10.244.1.0/24` and Node B `10.244.2.0/24`). This allocation is done by the cluster control plane (e.g., via the Controller Manager) and is crucial for determining packet routing between nodes.

- **Routing Table Configuration:**  
  Every node's routing table is updated to include routes for all Pod CIDRs in the cluster. This means:
  - When a packet destined for a Pod on a remote node is generated, the node's routing table determines that the destination IP is outside its local Pod CIDR.
  - The packet is then forwarded to the appropriate node (or next-hop) that owns that Pod CIDR.

### 3.2 The Role of CNI Plugins in Node-to-Node Networking

CNI plugins are responsible for the configuration of network interfaces, IP allocation, and the installation of necessary routes to ensure node-to-node connectivity. Their responsibilities include:

- **Interface Creation and Attachment:**  
  When a Pod is created, the CNI plugin creates a virtual Ethernet pair (veth pair):
  - One end is placed in the Pod’s network namespace (commonly as `eth0`).
  - The other end is attached to a bridge interface (e.g., `cni0`) or another network construct provided by the CNI plugin on the host.

- **Route Installation:**  
  The CNI plugin configures the host’s routing table so that each node knows how to reach every Pod CIDR. Depending on the network solution:
  - **Overlay Networks (e.g., Flannel):**  
    The plugin creates an overlay using encapsulation (often VXLAN). When a packet leaves a Pod destined for a Pod on another node, it is encapsulated in a VXLAN header and sent over the physical network. The receiving node decapsulates the packet and delivers it to the target Pod.
  - **Native Routing Solutions (e.g., Calico):**  
    The plugin leverages BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) to advertise Pod CIDRs between nodes. This allows nodes to route packets directly to the correct destination without encapsulation.
  - **eBPF-based Solutions (e.g., Cilium):**  
    The plugin uses extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) programs to modify packet processing dynamically, enabling efficient, policy-driven routing across nodes.

- **Encapsulation and Tunneling:**  
  When overlay networks are used, the CNI plugin handles encapsulating packets with additional headers to transport them across nodes. This encapsulation is necessary because the underlying physical network may not be aware of the cluster’s Pod CIDR scheme.

## 4. Under-the-Hood Process for Inter-Node Communication

### 4.1 Packet Flow from One Node to Another

Consider Pod A on Node 1 (with IP 10.244.1.10) communicating with Pod B on Node 2 (with IP 10.244.2.20):

1. **Packet Origin:**  
   Pod A generates a packet with destination IP 10.244.2.20.
   
2. **Local Node Processing (Node 1):**  
   - The packet is sent from Pod A’s `eth0` into Node 1’s virtual network (via its attached veth pair).
   - The CNI-configured bridge (or other mechanism) on Node 1 receives the packet.
   - The node’s routing table (populated by the CNI plugin) identifies that 10.244.2.20 is not local.
   
3. **Inter-Node Forwarding:**  
   - **Overlay Scenario:** If an overlay network is in use (e.g., Flannel), Node 1 encapsulates the packet with a VXLAN header and forwards it to Node 2’s IP.
   - **Native Routing Scenario:** If native routing is used (e.g., Calico), Node 1 forwards the packet directly based on the routing table, often using BGP-learned routes.
   
4. **Receiving Node Processing (Node 2):**  
   - Node 2 receives the packet and, if encapsulated, decapsulates it to reveal the original packet.
   - The packet is then delivered to the veth interface attached to Pod B’s network namespace.
   
5. **Final Delivery:**  
   Pod B receives the packet, completing the inter-node communication.

### 4.2 The Role of Underlying Physical Network
- **Physical Connectivity:**  
  For node-to-node communication to succeed, the underlying physical network must allow IP traffic between the nodes. This might involve:
  - Proper routing configuration in the data center.
  - Open firewall rules on the physical or virtual network.
- **Encapsulation Impact:**  
  In overlay networks, encapsulation adds overhead, so understanding the physical network’s performance characteristics is important for optimizing overall network throughput.

## 5. Summary

| **Aspect** | **Description** |
|------------|-----------------|
| **Pod CIDR Allocation** | Each node gets a unique range of IP addresses for Pods (e.g., 10.244.1.0/24 for Node 1, 10.244.2.0/24 for Node 2). |
| **Routing Table** | Nodes maintain routes to all Pod CIDRs, allowing direct packet forwarding to remote nodes. |
| **CNI Plugin Role** | Configures network interfaces, allocates IP addresses, sets up bridges, installs routing rules, and manages encapsulation (if necessary). |
| **Overlay Networks** | Use encapsulation (e.g., VXLAN) to tunnel Pod traffic across nodes, decapsulating on the receiving node. |
| **Native Routing (BGP)** | Uses BGP to advertise Pod CIDRs among nodes, enabling direct routing without encapsulation. |

**Key Takeaway:**  
Node-to-node networking in Kubernetes is the backbone that enables a flat, scalable, and efficient network across the cluster. The CNI plugin plays a central role by configuring the network stack on each node, ensuring that traffic is routed correctly—whether through overlay tunnels or native IP routing—and that all nodes are interconnected.

## 6. Conclusion

Understanding node-to-node networking is critical for diagnosing cluster-wide connectivity issues and optimizing the performance of Kubernetes clusters. The CNI plugin not only facilitates the assignment of Pod IPs and network interface creation but also establishes the routing mechanisms required for inter-node communication. As Kubernetes clusters scale and become more complex, efficient node-to-node networking ensures that the flat network model is maintained and that applications can communicate reliably across the entire cluster.
